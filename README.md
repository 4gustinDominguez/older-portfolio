My own website (portfolio) developed with React (with Hooks), Typescript and Styled-Components.

With this project I want to improve my knowledge about these technologies and show my skills and experience but above all learn more.

## Getting Started

You'll only have to follow the instructions below to be able to reproduce the project (You can use _npm_ or _yarn_):

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
