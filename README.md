# Own Website

## Content

My own website (portfolio) developed with React (with Hooks), Typescript, Styled-Components and Jest.

Tests automation by performing Continuous Integration Integration (CI) with CircleCI.

With this project I want to improve my knowledge about these technologies and show my skills and experience but above all learn more.
